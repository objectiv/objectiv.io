*We released v0.0.13, which enables analyzing marketing campaign performance.*

<!--truncate-->

UTM parameters in the URL (e.g. `utm_source=a&utm_medium=b&utm_campaign=c`) are the de-facto standard for 
tracking the performance of campaigns. In this release, we've added support for storing & analyzing these 
parameters.

## How it works
The Objectiv Collector now automatically stores any UTM parameters from the URL in a new 
[`MarketingContext`](https://objectiv.io/docs/taxonomy/reference/global-contexts/MarketingContext), which has 
been added to the open taxonomyâ€™s [`Global Contexts`](https://objectiv.io/docs/taxonomy/global-contexts).

The [Bach modeling library](https://objectiv.io/docs/modeling/) then supports using this new MarketingContext 
data in analyses, e.g. (first-touch) attribution to see which marketing channels convert or retain best. 

## The details
Check out:
- The [`MarketingContext`](https://objectiv.io/docs/taxonomy/reference/global-contexts/MarketingContext) in 
the open taxonomy docs, for details on the newly tracked data.
- The [Bach modeling library docs](https://objectiv.io/docs/modeling/), for how to easily analyze it. 

Enjoy analyzing your campaigns!
