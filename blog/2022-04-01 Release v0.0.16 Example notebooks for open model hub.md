*With this release we've added several example notebooks that help you get started with the 
[open model hub](https://objectiv.io/docs/modeling/) to analyze and model data. We've also released the 
Objectiv libraries to [PyPI](https://pypi.org/user/objectiv/).*

# What is the open model hub?
It's a growing collection of [open-source, free to use data models][models] that you can take, combine, and 
run for a wide range of typical product analytics use cases, from your notebook. 

It enables you to quickly cluster your users, explore your conversion, report on retention, and much more.

**An example of a very common model**: calculating *average session duration*. In the model hub, this is an 
[aggregation][duration] model that is called with [`model_hub.aggregate.session_duration()`][duration]. In 
the example below, we've used this model, and also added filtering on new users only, using a 
[mapping][models_mapping] model: [`modelhub.map.is_new_user()`][new_user].

  caption="Avg. daily session duration for new users in a notebook, with the model hub" />

With [`.head()`][head] you can immediately query the data to show the results, and with 
[`.to_pandas()`][to_pandas] use all results as a pandas object in python.

# Bach: the modeling library
The open model hub is powered by **[Bach][bach]**: Objectiv's data modeling library. With Bach, you can fully 
compose models with familiar Pandas-like dataframe operations. It uses an SQL abstraction layer that enables 
models to run on the full dataset, and can export to SQL with a single command. 

<BlogImage url='img/value-pandas-like-operations-on-full-dataset.svg' />

See for instance below for the underlying SQL query snippet generated by Bach for the 
[`session_duration()`][duration] model, by calling [`display_sql_as_markdown(avg_duration)`][display_md]:

```sql
[...several SELECTs and filtering]
"getitem_having_boolean___ddcf158ce4b9ea9d4318d5f57eb20bb5" as (select to_char("moment", 'YYYY-MM-DD') as "time_aggregation", "session_id" as "_session_id", min("moment") as "moment_min", max("moment") as "moment_max", ((max("moment")) - (min("moment"))) as "session_duration" 
from "getitem_where_boolean___42ef48db14f4e03bdac4ba717cf7ee3c" 
 
group by (to_char("moment", 'YYYY-MM-DD'), "session_id") 
having (((max("moment")) - (min("moment"))) > '0') 
 
 
)
select "time_aggregation" as "time_aggregation", avg("session_duration") as "session_duration" 
from "getitem_having_boolean___ddcf158ce4b9ea9d4318d5f57eb20bb5" 
 
group by ("time_aggregation") 
```

# Example notebooks
We now have [several Jupyter notebook examples][examples] in our GitHub repository to get you started on the 
open model hub & Bach. For instance:
* How to use the open model hub for basic **[product analytics][ex_product_analytics]**.
* How to use Bach with **[rich open analytics taxonomy data][ex_taxonomy]**.
* How to use Bach for **[feature engineering][ex_features]**.
* How to use Bach + sklearn for **[Machine Learning directly on the raw data in your SQL database][ex_ml]**, 
such as user clustering.

# How to use it
For a quick-start, there’s a [Docker-based demo][quickstart] that runs the full Objectiv pipeline on your 
local machine, including a Jupyter notebook environment with all the new example notebooks. 

If you’re ready to use the open model hub and/or Bach in your notebooks, head on over to our 
[Modeling documentation][models]. The package can now be installed with `pip`:

```bash
pip install objectiv-modelhub
```

# More models are coming
We’re continuously expanding the available set of models. One of the models that we’re working on right now 
is **Impact Scores**: scoring the impact of user interactions on your product goals, such as conversion.

To get updates on new models, star our [repo][repo].

Enjoy the new example notebooks!
