*With this release we've added several example notebooks that help you get started with the 
[open model hub](https://objectiv.io/docs/modeling/) to analyze and model data. We've also released the 
Objectiv libraries to [PyPI](https://pypi.org/user/objectiv/).*

# What is the open model hub?
It's a growing collection of [open-source, free to use data models][models] that you can take, combine, and 
run for a wide range of typical product analytics use cases, from your notebook. 

It enables you to quickly cluster your users, explore your conversion, report on retention, and much more.

**An example of a very common model**: calculating *average session duration*. In the model hub, this is an 
[aggregation][duration] model that is called with [`model_hub.aggregate.session_duration()`][duration]. In 
the example below, we've used this model, and also added filtering on new users only, using a 
[mapping](https://objectiv.io/docs/modeling/models_mapping) model: [`modelhub.map.is_new_user()`][new_user].

<BlogImage 
  url='img/blog/releases/0.0.16-session_duration.png' 
  caption="Avg. daily session duration for new users in a notebook, with the model hub" />

With [`.head()`][head] you can immediately query the data to show the results, and with 
[`.to_pandas()`][to_pandas] use all results as a pandas object in python.

# Bach: the modeling library
The open model hub is powered by **[Bach][bach]**: Objectiv's data modeling library. With Bach, you can fully 
compose models with familiar Pandas-like dataframe operations. It uses an SQL abstraction layer that enables 
models to run on the full dataset, and can export to SQL with a single command. 

<BlogImage url='img/value-pandas-like-operations-on-full-dataset.svg' />

See for instance below for the underlying SQL query snippet generated by Bach for the 
[`session_duration()`][duration] model, by calling [`display_sql_as_markdown(avg_duration)`][display_md]:

# Example notebooks
We now have [several Jupyter notebook examples][examples] in our GitHub repository to get you started on the 
open model hub & Bach. For instance:
* How to use the open model hub for basic **[product analytics][ex_product_analytics]**.
* How to use Bach with **[rich open analytics taxonomy data][ex_taxonomy]**.
* How to use Bach for **[feature engineering][ex_features]**.
* How to use Bach + sklearn for **[Machine Learning directly on the raw data in your SQL database][ex_ml]**, 
such as user clustering.

# How to use it
For a quick-start, thereâ€™s a [Docker-based demo][quickstart] that runs the full Objectiv pipeline on your 
local machine, including a Jupyter notebook environment with all the new example notebooks. 

If youâ€™re ready to use the open model hub and/or Bach in your notebooks, head on over to our 
[Modeling documentation][models]. The packages you need can now be installed with `pip`:

```bash
pip install objectiv-modelhub
pip install objectiv-bach
```

# More models are coming
Weâ€™re continuously expanding the available set of models. One of the models that weâ€™re working on right now 
is **Impact Scores**: scoring the impact of user interactions on your product goals, such as conversion.

To get updates on new models, star our [repo][repo].

Enjoy the new example notebooks!
