*With this release of Objectiv v0.0.16 we now provide a Tracker SDK for React Native, so you can use 
[Objectiv's advanced modeling](https://objectiv.io/docs/modeling/) on your mobile app's user behavior data 
as well.*

Analytics tracking instrumentation shouldn't cost you a lot of time. So we've put a lot of effort into 
ensuring that it's incredibly simple and quick.

## How does it work?

One of the key aspects of Objectiv is the 
[Location Stack](https://objectiv.io/docs/tracking/core-concepts/locations), which captures the exact 
location where an Event was triggered 
([more on how & why in this post](./2022-02-16%20Location%20Stack.md)). 

```json title="An example Location Stack in Objectiv"
{
 "_type": "PressEvent",
 "location_stack": [
   {
     "_type": "RootLocationContext",
     "id": "modeling"
   },
   {
     "_type": "NavigationContext",
     "id": "docs-sidebar"
   },
   {
     "_type": "ExpandableContext",
     "id": "api-reference"
   },
   {
     "_type": "ExpandableContext",
     "id": "dataframe"
   },
   {
     "_type": "LinkContext",
     "id": "overview",
     "href": "/docs/modeling/DataFrame""
   }
 ]
}
```

The new SDK automatically hooks into UI components that come with React Native, plus the React Navigation 
routing library that is used by many apps.

As a result, to instrument your application, simply:
1. Initialize 
[**the tracker**](https://objectiv.io/docs/tracking/react-native/how-to-guides/getting-started#configure-the-tracker) 
& configure the 
[**React Navigation Plugin**](https://objectiv.io/docs/tracking/react-native/how-to-guides/getting-started/#installing-react-navigation-plugin);
2. And then 
**swap the respective [UI Components](https://objectiv.io/docs/tracking/react-native/api-reference/trackedComponents/overview/)** 
with the ones provided in the new SDK, e.g. anything that's interactive.

User interactions are then automatically tracked, including their full 
[Location Stack](https://objectiv.io/docs/tracking/core-concepts/locations).

For example, to track this Button and where it was clicked:

```tsx
import { Button } from 'react-native';

<Button
 onPress={onPressHandler}
 title="Learn More"
/>
```

...simply swap it with its Tracked version:


```tsx
import { TrackedButton } from '@objectiv/tracker-react-native';

<TrackedButton
 onPress={onPressHandler}
 title="Learn More"
/>
```

Some other examples of automatically tracked components:
* [React Navigation Links](https://objectiv.io/docs/tracking/react-native/how-to-guides/getting-started#tracking-navigation-links).
* [Tabs & Drawers](https://objectiv.io/docs/tracking/react-native/how-to-guides/getting-started#tracking-tabs--drawers).
* [Inputs](https://objectiv.io/docs/tracking/react-native/how-to-guides/tracking-interactions#input-change).
* [Etc](https://objectiv.io/docs/tracking/react-native/api-reference/trackedComponents/overview).

Optionally, you can 
[enrich your interactions' Locations](https://objectiv.io/docs/tracking/react-native/how-to-guides/tracking-locations) 
further to make modeling even easier.

## Manual instrumentation
If for any reason manual instrumentation is required, the SDK comes also with a set of 
[Hooks](https://objectiv.io/docs/tracking/react-native/api-reference/hooks/overview/) and 
[low-level Event Trackers](https://staging.objectiv.io/docs/tracking/react-native/api-reference/eventTrackers/overview/) 
to trigger Events programmatically, or to create your own 
[Custom Components](https://staging.objectiv.io/docs/tracking/react-native/how-to-guides/custom-components).

## How to get it
The new React Native SDK can be found on [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/org/objectiv), so just do:

```bash
yarn add @objectiv/tracker-react-native

# or

npm install @objectiv/tracker-react-native
```

Give it a try, and please do <JoinSlackLink linkText='let us know what you think on Slack' />.

Enjoy tracking your mobile apps!
