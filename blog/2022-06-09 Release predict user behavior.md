## How to get it
The three new models are now live in the [open model hub][model_hub]. To use them, install the package from 
PyPI:

```bash
pip install objectiv-modelhub
```

If you already have the package installed, don't forget to upgrade:

```console
pip install --upgrade objectiv-modelhub
```

:::tip

If you want to test run these models on your own product without worrying about the Ops part, reach out to us 
to get a [Launchpad][launchpad]: a free-to-use, fully managed Objectiv back-end and data store without any 
setup or configuration.
