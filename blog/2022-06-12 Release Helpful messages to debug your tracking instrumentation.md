<intro>

Objectiv lets you model raw analytics data straight out of the box. This is partly enabled by early data 
validation against the [open analytics taxonomy][taxonomy] (also making instrumentation unambiguous and 
future-proof), and partly by helping developers set up tracking instrumentation with helpful tooling. 


In this release we focused on the second part: we added links to relevant documentation pages in the Tracker 
SDK's Validation messages, to help you debug your tracking instrumentation.
