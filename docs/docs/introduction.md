## Welcome to the official Objectiv documentation
Objectiv is a complete, self-hosted product analytics stack designed for
data science without gruntwork.

<img src={useBaseUrl('/img/objectiv-stack.svg')} alt="The Objectiv Stack"/>

It includes everything you need to answer your product analytics questions with speed and precision.
Straight from your notebook on the full, raw dataset. No cleaning, transformations or tracking plans required.

### Highlights
* Collect [model-ready data](/tracking/core-concepts) that doesn't require cleaning and transformation
* Ensure compatibility with many models by validating against an [open analytics taxonomy](/taxonomy/introduction.md)
* Build reusable models with [Pandas-like modeling](/modeling/intro.mdx) that runs on the full dataset
* Chain together custom & [pre-built models](/modeling/Objectiv/bach_open_taxonomy.ModelHub) to answer in-depth questions quickly
