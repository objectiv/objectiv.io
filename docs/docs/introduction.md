## Objectiv Documentation
Objectiv is open-source infrastructure for product analytics. Highlights:

* Collect [model-ready user behavior data](/tracking/core-concepts/overview.md) and feed it straight into 
  your data warehouse.
* Use [pandas-like operations](/modeling/intro.mdx) and [pre-built models](/modeling/models.mdx) that run on 
  the full SQL dataset.
* Instantly convert models to SQL to feed all data consumers from a single source of truth.
