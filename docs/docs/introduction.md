# Objectiv Documentation

#### Objectiv is open-source infrastructure for product analytics. 

* Collect [model-ready user behavior data](/tracking/core-concepts/overview.md) and feed it straight into 
  your data warehouse.
* Use [pandas-like operations](/modeling/index.mdx) and [pre-built models](./modeling/open-model-hub/models/index.mdx) that run on 
  the full SQL dataset.
* Instantly convert models to SQL to feed all data consumers from a single source of truth.
