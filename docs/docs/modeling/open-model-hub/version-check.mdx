# Version check

The Objectiv [ModelHub](/modeling/open-model-hub/api-reference/ModelHub/index.mdx) package comes with a built-in version checker.
During import, it automatically checks if the loaded version is the most recent version.

**Why?**

We are adding new models and taxonomy operations at a high pace, so the goal of this version check is to
notify you when new models & taxonomy operations are available to use.

**How?**

An asynchronous HTTP request to [https://version-check.objectiv.io](https://version-check.objectiv.io) is sent on package import. A Python warning
message is issued in case a new version is available.

**What data is being sent?**

Your current version of objectiv-modelhub and objectiv-bach. No cookies, IPs or any other PII is being sent.

**Disable the version check**

Disable the check by setting the environment variable `OBJECTIV_VERSION_CHECK_DISABLE` to `true` prior to
importing objectiv-modelhub.
