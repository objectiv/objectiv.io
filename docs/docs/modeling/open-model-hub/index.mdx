# Open model hub

The open model hub is a toolkit with functions and models that can run directly on a full dataset collected
with Objectiv’s Tracker SDKs. All models are open-source, free to use, and can easily be combined to build
advanced compound models.

## How to use the open model hub

Three types of functions/models are provided:
1. [Helper functions](/modeling/open-model-hub/models/helper-functions/index.mdx): simplify manipulating and analyzing the data.
2. [Aggregation models](/modeling/open-model-hub/models/aggregation/index.mdx): enable running some of the more common data
analyses and product analytics metrics.
3. [Machine learning models](/modeling/open-model-hub/models/machine-learning/index.mdx).

Modeling behavior of users and groups is enabled through configurable
[Identity Resolution](/modeling/open-model-hub/identity-resolution.mdx).

See how to [get started in your notebook](/modeling/get-started-in-your-notebook.mdx) and the
[example notebooks](/modeling/example-notebooks/index.mdx), and install the model hub package directly from PyPI:

```console
pip install objectiv-modelhub
```

## Powered by Bach

The open model hub is powered by [Bach](/modeling/bach/index.mdx): Objectiv’s data modeling library. With Bach, you can
compose models with familiar Pandas-like dataframe operations that use an SQL abstraction layer to run on the
full dataset. Models can be output to SQL with one command.
