# Open model hub

The open model hub is a toolkit that contains functions and models that can be applied on data collected with
Objectiv’s Tracker. There are three types of functions/models:
1. Helper functions. These helper functions simplify manipulating and analyzing the data.
2. Aggregation models. These models consist of a combination of Bach instructions that run some of the more common data analyses or product analytics metrics.
3. Machine learning models.

All models are open-source, free to use, and can be combined to build advanced compound models with little effort. The open model hub is powered by [Bach](/modeling/bach/index.mdx): Objectiv’s data modeling library.

If you want to use the open model hub, install the package from PyPI as follows:

```console
pip install objectiv-modelhub
```

See the [example notebooks](/modeling/example-notebooks/index.mdx#example-notebooks) section to get started immediately.

View the list of available models [here](/modeling/open-model-hub/models/index.mdx) or check out the full
[open model hub API reference](/modeling/open-model-hub/api-reference/index.mdx#open-model-hub-api-reference).

More information on setting up a development environment for the open model hub and how to configure Metabase
is in the [readme](https://github.com/objectiv/objectiv-analytics/tree/main/modelhub).

The open model hub is powered by [Bach](/modeling/bach/index.mdx): Objectiv’s data modeling library. With Bach, you can
compose models with familiar Pandas-like dataframe operations in your notebook. It uses a SQL abstraction
layer that enables models to run on the full dataset, and you can output models to SQL with a single command.
Head over to the [Bach](/modeling/bach/index.mdx) section to learn all about it.
