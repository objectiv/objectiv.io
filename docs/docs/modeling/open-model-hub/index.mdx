# Open model hub

Data collected with Objectiv’s Tracker and stored in an SQL database can be analyzed in a Jupyter notebook
with the **open model hub**. The open model hub is a growing collection of open-source, free to use data
models that you can take, combine and run for product analysis and exploration. It includes models for a wide
range of typical product analytics use cases.

If you want to use the open model hub, install the package from Pypi as follows:

```console
pip install objectiv-modelhub
```

See the [example notebooks](/docs/modeling/example-notebooks) section to get started immediately.

View the list of available models [here](/docs/modeling/open-model-hub/models) or check out the full
[open model hub API reference](/docs/modeling/open-model-hub/api-reference).

More information on setting up a development environment for the open model hub and how to configure Metabase
is in the [readme](https://github.com/objectiv/objectiv-analytics/tree/main/modelhub).

The open model hub is powered by [Bach](/docs/modeling/bach): Objectiv’s data modeling library. With Bach, you can
compose models with familiar Pandas-like dataframe operations in your notebook. It uses a SQL abstraction
layer that enables models to run on the full dataset, and you can output models to SQL with a single command.
Head over to the [Bach](/docs/modeling/bach) section to learn all about it.
