Get all variables that influence the values of this DataFrame.
This includes both variables that are used in the current `self.series`, but also variables that
were used in earlier steps, i.e. in the SqlModels of `self.base_node`.

The output of this method can be useful for diagnosing issues with variables. If a variable is used
multiple times, then it will appear here multiple times. If a variable has conflicting definitions
then the conflicting dtypes and/or values are all returned.

**Returned data**

This method returns a list of DefinedVariable tuples, the fields in the tuples:

* name: name of the variable


* dtype: dtype


* value: value that is currently set in `self.variables`, or None if there is no value


* ref_path: If the variable is used in an already materialized part of the DataFrame, i.e.
the usage is in self.base_node, then this is the reference path from self.base_node to the
SqlModel in which the variable usage occurs. If the variable is used in self.series instead,
then this is None


* old_value: If the variable is used in an already materialized part of the DataFrame, then it
also has a value already. That is this value. Will be None if this variable usage is not in
self.base_node.




### Returns

List with all usages of variables in this DataFrame.



### Return type

*List*[bach.dataframe.DefinedVariable]
