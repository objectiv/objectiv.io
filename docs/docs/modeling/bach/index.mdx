# Bach

Bach is Objectivâ€™s data modeling library. With Bach, you can compose models with familiar Pandas-like
dataframe operations in your notebook. It uses an SQL abstraction layer that enables models to run on the
full dataset, and you can output models to SQL with a single command. It includes a set of operations that
enable effective feature creation for data sets that embrace the open analytics taxonomy.

If you want to use Bach, install the package from PyPI as follows:

```console
pip install objectiv-bach
```

To get a taste of what you can do with Objectiv Bach, There is also a [demo](/docs/home/quickstart-guide)
available that enables you to run the full Objectiv pipeline on your local machine. It includes our website
as a demo app, a Jupyter Notebook environment with working models and a Metabase environment to output data
to.
