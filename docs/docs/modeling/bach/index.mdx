# Bach

Bach is Objectivâ€™s data modeling library to build & compose models with familiar [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/index.html)-like dataframe operations in your notebook. It uses
an SQL abstraction layer that enables models to run on the full dataset. As all data storage and processing
is handled by the database, local memory does not limit the size of the data that can be analyzed. See more
details on this in the [Core Concepts](/modeling/bach/core-concepts.mdx). Any model you build can subsequently be output
to SQL with a single command, for use in tools like BI or dbt.

Bach also specifically includes a set of operations to work with datasets that embrace the
[open analytics taxonomy](/docs/taxonomy/).

The package can be installed from PyPI:

```console
pip install objectiv-bach
```

## How to use

Once your app is [tracking data](/docs/tracking/), follow the steps in the [examples](/modeling/bach/examples.mdx)
to work with Bach.

The two main data classes in Bach are the DataFrame and Series:

* A [`DataFrame`](/modeling/bach/api-reference/DataFrame/bach.DataFrame.mdx) represents data in a tabular form, with all rows having the same columns, and each
column having a specific data type and a distinct name.
* A [`Series`](/modeling/bach/api-reference/Series/bach.Series.mdx) object represents a single column in a DataFrame, with different subclasses per data
type that allow for type specific operations.
