# Example notebooks

This section contains several example notebooks on how you can analyze and model data using the
[open model hub](/modeling/open-model-hub/index.mdx#open-model-hub). All examples are also available as Jupyter notebooks from our [GitHub
repository](https://github.com/objectiv/objectiv-analytics/tree/main/notebooks).

For every example notebook below, refer to
[getting started in your notebook](/modeling/get-started-in-your-notebook.mdx) on how to connect to a data store
and instantiate an Objectiv DataFrame:
