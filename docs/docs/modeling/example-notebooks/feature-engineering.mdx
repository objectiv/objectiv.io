# Feature engineering with Bach

This example shows how Bach can be used for feature engineering. We’ll go through describing the data, finding
outliers, transforming data and grouping and aggregating data so that a useful feature set is created that
can be used for machine learning. We have a separate example available that goes into the details of how a
data set prepared in Bach can be used for machine learning with sklearn
[here](/modeling/example-notebooks/machine-learning.mdx).

This example is also available in a [notebook](https://github.com/objectiv/objectiv-analytics/blob/main/notebooks/feature-engineering.ipynb)
to run on your own data or use our
[quickstart](https://objectiv.io/docs/home/quickstart-guide/) to try it out with demo data in 5 minutes.

At first we have to install the open model hub and instantiate the Objectiv DataFrame object. See
[Getting started with Objectiv](/modeling/example-notebooks/index.mdx#getting-started-with-objectiv) for more info on this.

This object points to all data in the data set. Too large to run in pandas and therefore sklearn. For the
data set that we need, we aggregate to user level, at which point it is small enough to fit in memory.

We start with showing the first couple of rows from the data set and describing the entire data set.

```python
df.head()
```

Columns of interest are ‘user_id’, this is what we will aggregate to. ‘moment’ contains timestamp info for the
events. [global_contexts](/modeling/example-notebooks/open-taxonomy.mdx#global-contexts) and the [location_stack](/modeling/example-notebooks/open-taxonomy.mdx#location-stack) contain most of the event specific data.

```python
df.describe(include='all').head()
```

## Creating a feature set

We’d like to create a feature set that describes the behaviour of users in a way. We start with extracting
the root location from the location stack. This indicates what parts of our website users have visited. Using
`to_numpy()` shows the results as a numpy array.

```python
df['root'] = df.location_stack.ls.get_from_context_with_type_series(type='RootLocationContext', key='id')
df.root.unique().to_numpy()
```

`[‘jobs’, ‘docs’, ‘home’…]` etc is returned, the sections of the objectiv.io website.

## Check missing values

```python
df.root.isnull().value_counts().head()
```

A quick check learns us that there are no missing values to worry about. Now we want a data set with
interactions on our different sections, in particular, presses. This is an event type. We first want an
overview of the different event types that exist and select the one we are interested in.

```python
df.event_type.unique().to_numpy()
```

We are interested in ‘PressEvent’.

## Creating the variables

The next code block shows that we select only press events and then group
by ‘user_id’ and ‘root’ and count the session_hit_number. After that the results are unstacked, resulting in
a table where each row represents a user (the index is ‘user_id’) and the columns are the different root
locations and its values are the number of times a user clicked in that sections.

```python
features = df[(df.event_type=='PressEvent')].groupby(['user_id','root']).session_hit_number.count()
features_unstacked = features.unstack()
features_unstacked.head()
```

## Fill empty values

Now we do have empty values, so we fill them with 0, as empty means that the user did not click in the
section.

```python
features_unstacked = features.unstack(fill_value=0)
```

## Describe the data set

We use describe again to get an impression of out created per-user data set.

```python
features_unstacked.materialize().describe().head()
```

Looking at the mean, some sections seem to be used a lot more than others. Also the max
number of clicks seems quite different per root section. This information can be used to drop some of the
variables from our data set or the use scaling or outlier detection. We will plot histograms for the

## Visualize the data

```python
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
figure, axis = plt.subplots(2, 4,figsize=(15,10))

for idx, name in enumerate(features_unstacked.data_columns):
    df_bins = features_unstacked[name].cut(bins=5)
    df_bins.value_counts().to_pandas().plot(title = name, kind='bar', ax=axis.flat[idx])
plt.tight_layout()
```

The histograms show that indeed the higher values seem quite anomalous for most of the root locations. This
could be a reason to drop some of these observations or resort to scaling methods. For now we continue with
the data set as is.

## Add time feature

Now we want to add some time feature to our data set. We add the average session length per user to the data
set. We can use the model hub for this. `fillna` is used to fill missing values.

```python
import datetime
features_unstacked['session_duration'] = modelhub.agg.session_duration(df, groupby='user_id').fillna(datetime.timedelta(0))
```

## Export to pandas for sklearn

Now that we have our data set, we can use it for machine learning, using for example sklearn. To do so
we call `to_pandas()` to get a pandas DataFrame that can be used in sklearn.

```python
pdf = features_unstacked.to_pandas()
```
