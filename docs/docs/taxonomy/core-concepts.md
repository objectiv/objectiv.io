# Taxonomy Core Concepts

import Mermaid from '@theme/Mermaid';

The open analytics taxonomy consists of:
* Classes for each common analytics event type, called Events.
* The Contexts in which they happen.
* Their properties, requirements and inheritance.

## Global Contexts
[Global Contexts](/taxonomy/reference/global-contexts/overview.md) add general information to an [Event](/taxonomy/reference/events/overview.md). 

## Location Contexts
[Location Contexts](/taxonomy/reference/location-contexts/overview.md) are meant to describe where an [Event](/taxonomy/reference/events/overview.md) originated from in the visual UI. 

## Events
Describe interactive and non-interactive [Events](/taxonomy/reference/events/overview.md).
