# Introduction

Objectiv is built around the open taxonomy of analytics, which is our proposal for a common way to collect, structure and validate data.

Using the open taxonomy ensures models & data can be reused, and data scientists can build on the knowledge and practices of others. In most cases you can skip the discussion on what to track, because it is designed to cover a wide range of common analytics use cases.

Based on this taxonomy, we're developing [tracking](/tracking/introduction.md), [validation](/tracking/core-concepts/collector.md) and [modeling](/modeling) libraries:

Just like the rest of the code, the taxonomy is open source and 
we're building it in public. If you have any ideas or opinions on where to take it next, please see our 
[Contribution Guide](/the-project/contributing.md) and join us on [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/objectiv-io/shared_invite/zt-u6xma89w-DLDvOB7pQer5QUs5B_~5pg).

## Core Concepts
To understand in more detail how the Taxonomy works, read about the underlying core concepts.
