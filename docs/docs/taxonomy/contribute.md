# Help develop the open analytics taxonomy

[repo]: https://github.com/objectiv/objectiv-analytics
[schema]: https://github.com/objectiv/objectiv-analytics/tree/main/schema

We're very keen on hearing your feedback on where to take the open analytics taxonomy. If you have a 
suggestion on what to add or change, please follow these steps:

1. Submit an issue on our [objectiv-analytics repo][repo], describing what you’d like to see and why. There’s 
   a template called _'Taxonomy Contribution'_ for this.
2. We’ll discuss any questions in the issue. Once we agree to move forward, we’ll ask you to open up a simple 
   PR with just your proposed changes to [the schema][schema]. This way, you’ll be credited as the original 
   contributor.
3. We will develop the changes to the corresponding components (e.g. Tracker and/or Collector) with our team, 
   and will keep you posted <JoinSlackLink linkText='on Slack' />.

Thanks for helping us build a complete and generic open tracking standard, so we can share and reuse data 
models!
