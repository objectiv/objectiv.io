# Tracker API Reference

import LocationTaggersOverview from './locationTaggers/overview.md'

Angular Tracker is built on top of [Browser Tracker](/tracking/browser/api-reference/general/BrowserTracker.md). This means all the Browser Tracker functionality is available also in Angular.

On top of that the Angular module comes with a Directive to ease the usage of Location Taggers in Angular templates. 

## Location Taggers via Angular Directive
<LocationTaggersOverview />
