Looking to get help, found a bug or just have a question? Reporting it at the right place will ensure a quick response from our team:

* If your question is roughly "I've hit this error and am stuck", please ask it in the **Troubleshooting** 
  channel of our 
  [Slack community](https://join.slack.com/t/objectiv-io/shared_invite/zt-u6xma89w-DLDvOB7pQer5QUs5B_~5pg).

* For security issues, please email [security@objectiv.io](mailto:security@objectiv.io) to avoid publicizing 
  means of exploitation.
* If you are looking for an opinionated answer (e.g. "What's the best approach to X?", "Why is Y done this 
  way?"), just ask our devs in the **Lobby** channel of our 
  [Slack community](https://join.slack.com/t/objectiv-io/shared_invite/zt-u6xma89w-DLDvOB7pQer5QUs5B_~5pg).
