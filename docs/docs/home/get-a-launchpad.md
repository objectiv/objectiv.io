A Launchpad is a **fully managed Objectiv back-end and data store** that’s ready to use without any setup or configuration. Our Launchpads are free to use and enable you to quickly test-drive Objectiv on your own app or website without needing to worry about the OPS part.

### How does it work?

Objectiv will set up your Launchpad and provide instructions on how to connect to it. You can then [instrument Objectiv’s tracking SDK](/tracking/) to a part of your site or app to start collecting data. On average, this takes existing users a few hours.

After collecting testing data, you can take any of the [example notebooks](/modeling/example-notebooks/) and run them on your own data set. You can also build and run your own models by using the [Bach](/modeling/bach/) modeling library.

### What happens to my data?

Your data will be stored securely in a virtual private cloud, located in EU. Launchpads are purely meant for testing Objectiv and should not be used in production.  Data collection is for the sole purpose of enabling you to experience what you can do with Objectiv and it is not shared with anyone else.

### How much does it cost? How do I get one?

Launchpads are free to use, but limited slots are available. <JoinSlackLink linkText='Join us on Slack' /> and DM Ivar Pruijn.

### Can I use my Launchpad in production?

Launchpads are meant for testing purposes only, but our team would be happy to assist you in getting your testing environment to production.
