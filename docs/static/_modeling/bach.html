<p>Bach is Objectiv&#8217;s data modeling library. With Bach, you can compose models with familiar Pandas-like
dataframe operations in your notebook. It uses a SQL abstraction layer that enables models to run on the
full dataset, and you can output models to SQL with a single command. It includes a set of operations that
enable effective feature creation for datasets that embrace the open taxonomy of analytics.</p>
<p>To get a taste of what you can do with Objectiv Bach, There is a <a class="reference external" href="/docs/home/quickstart-guide">demo</a> available that enables you to run the full Objectiv pipeline on your local
machine. It includes our website as a demo app, a Jupyter Notebook
environment with working models and a Metabase environment to output data to.</p>
