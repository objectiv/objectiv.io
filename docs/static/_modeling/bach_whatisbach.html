<p>Bach is a library for analysing data that is stored in a SQL database. Currently we only support Postgres,
but we plan on supporting more databases. We&#8217;re using an interface that&#8217;s mostly compatible with <a class="reference external" href="https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/index.html">pandas</a>. All data storage and
processing is handled by the database. As a result, local memory does not limit the size of the data that
can be analysed with Bach.</p>
<p>The two main data classes of Bach are the DataFrame and Series:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>A <code class="xref py py-class docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">DataFrame</span></code> represents data in a tabular form, with all rows having the same
columns, and each column having a specific data type and a distinct name.</p></li>
<li><p>A <code class="xref py py-class docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Series</span></code> object represents a single column in a DataFrame, with
different subclasses per data type that allow for type specific operations.</p></li>
</ul>
