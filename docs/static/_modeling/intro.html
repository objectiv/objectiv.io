<p>Bach is Objectiv&#8217;s data modeling library. With Bach, you can compose models with familiar Pandas-like
dataframe operations in your notebook. It uses a SQL abstraction layer that enables models to run on the
full dataset, and you can output models to SQL with a single command. It includes a set of operations that
enable effective feature creation for datasets that embrace the open taxonomy of analytics.</p>
<p>To get a taste of what you can do with Objectiv Bach, There is a <a class="reference external" href="/docs/home/quickstart-guide">demo</a> available that enables you to run the full Objectiv pipeline on your local machine. It includes our website as a demo app, a Jupyter Notebook
environment with working models and a Metabase environment to output data to.</p>

<h2>What is Bach?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-is-bach" title="Permalink to this headline">&#182;</a></h2>
<p>Bach is a library for analysing data that is stored in a SQL database. Currently we only support Postgres,
but we plan on supporting more databases. We&#8217;re using an interface that&#8217;s mostly compatible with <a class="reference external" href="https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/index.html">pandas</a>. All data storage and
processing is handled by the database. As a result, local memory does not limit the size of the data that
can be analysed with Bach.</p>
<p>The two main data classes of Bach are the DataFrame and Series:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>A <a class="reference internal" href="DataFrame/bach.DataFrame.html#bach.DataFrame" title="bach.DataFrame"><code class="xref py py-class docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">DataFrame</span></code></a> represents data in a tabular form, with all rows having the same
columns, and each column having a specific data type and a distinct name.</p></li>
<li><p>A <a class="reference internal" href="Series/bach.Series.html#bach.Series" title="bach.Series"><code class="xref py py-class docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Series</span></code></a> object represents a single column in a DataFrame, with
different subclasses per data type that allow for type specific operations.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Once your app is set up with the Objectiv tracker and the collector is running, follow the steps in the
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/objectiv/objectiv-analytics/tree/main/analysis#setup-objectiv-for-data-analysis">readme</a>
to work with the data in python using Objectiv.</p>
