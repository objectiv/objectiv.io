<p>Data collected with Objectiv&#8217;s Tracker and stored in an SQL database can be analyzed
in a Jupyter notebook with the open model
hub. The open model hub is a growing collection of open-source, free to use data models that you can take,
combine and run for product analysis and exploration. It includes models for a wide range of typical product
analytics use cases.</p>
<p>See the <a class="reference internal" href="example_notebooks.html#example-notebooks"><span class="std std-ref">example notebooks</span></a> section to get started immediately. View the list of
available models <a class="reference internal" href="models.html#models"><span class="std std-ref">here</span></a> or check out the full
<a class="reference internal" href="modelhub_api_reference.html#modelhub-api-reference"><span class="std std-ref">open model hub api reference</span></a>.</p>
<p>The open model hub is powered by Bach: Objectiv&#8217;s data modeling library. With Bach, you can compose models with
familiar Pandas-like dataframe operations in your notebook. It uses a SQL abstraction layer that enables
models to run on the full dataset, and you can output models to SQL with a single command. Head over to the
